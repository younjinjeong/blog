## Spring Cloud Data Flow with Demo 

Based on Fred Melo's talk (@fredmelo_br), this session describes what is Spring Cloud Data Flow, what's the benefits using it, and how it works. For many years, Enterprises were used ESB or ETL for their data moving part. But it's not enought to handle real-time data process and various tool for different analytic problems. In this talk, audiences will get an idea how they create "Data Microservices" for flexible data pipelining. 

* Traditional Data Moving and it's problems 
* Intorduing Spring Cloud Data Flow 
* Fraud Detection demo 
* How it can be used in your architecture 


## Project Riff for Open Source FaaS 

FaaS (Function as a Service) is becoming a new way of build services. Beyond Micro Services, it offers Micro Service as a Function. And it's based on "event-driven" pattern as native.  There are some famous FaaS such as AWS Lambda, but public offerings are having limits to use sometimes. It will be better soon, but Enterprise need another way to use FaaS for various reasons such as security, long running processes (LRP), event driven with other legacy services. [Project Riff](http://projectriff) has designed for this requirements. And it will be a part of Pivotal Cloud Foundry as PFS(Pivotal Function Services) for Enterprise use, but others can use it as an open source.  

* Introducing Project Riff 
* Set a Riff Environment on Kubernetes 
* Deploy a Function to Riff 
* How it works
