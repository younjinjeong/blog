## Recipe

*Serving size: One Pair*

### Ingredients
* 2 Engineers
* 1 Computer
* 2 Mice
* 2 Keyboards
* 2 Monitors
* 1 Codebase
* 1 Problem to Solve

### Secret Sauce
* Honesty
* Empathy
* Trust
* Constant communication
* Fast feedback
* Regular breaks
* Sharing
* And caring!

### Directions
1. Set up the *computer* so that *both monitors* show a mirrored display, and each *mouse* and *keyboard* is able to control it.
1. Select any other *engineer* on your team as your pair.
1. Pick the team's highest priority *problem* to work on.
1. Talk with your pair about how you should tackle the problem. You will need to agree on a direction before any *code* can get written!
1. Take turns *sharing* control of the mouse and keyboard, *constantly communicating* your thoughts when you have them, and helping each other to solve the problem at hand.
1. When you run into a disagreement, you have to stop coding and have an *honest* chat about the pros and cons of each possible direction. You may pull in another pair to chat about technical decisions, or talk to a product manager or designer to check your understanding of the problem.
1. *Trust* your pair's solution and try it out together so you can get *fast feedback* about whether it's the right direction.
1. It's been a rough day, so in a display of *empathy*, your pair asks if you need a *break*. After all, pairing is *caring*!
1. After a walk and a coffee break, you deliver some code and celebrate success together!

## Comments

**Internet Critic** commented: I feel like there's no way pairing can be more effective than two smart developers working separately. What gives?

> **Avery & Bella** replied: The secret about the secret sauce of pairing, empathy, trust, constant communication, fast feedback, etc., is that it isn't a secret! These qualities will help any team be more effective at working together to solve problems and deliver better products faster. If a team isn't pairing, they often need to spend lots of additional time and effort to build all of these qualities up. We think these qualities are essential to effective and productive software development, so why not build this into your discipline, all day, every day? Pairing is a great way to do that! We'll be sure to address the effectiveness of pairing in a future post.

**Super Hacker** commented: What if I'm pairing and I really need to check my email or Facebook? I don't want my pair snooping on my personal info!

> **Avery & Bella** replied: We work hard to limit the need for any one team member to need to respond to email or other messages. If you need to check your messages, get on Facebook, or whatever else you need, tell your pair you need a break during the day. But pairing requires a lot of focus and lack of distractions. Find ways of limiting those distractions for you and your team!

**Anon E. Mouse** commented: Help! I really want to try this recipe, but my developers aren't co-located. What do I do?

> **Avery & Bella** replied: Sometimes, your developers may not be able to sit together at one computer. While this is less ideal, it can be solved by substituting one computer with two computers, each with a webcam, high-quality headphones, and screen-sharing software. A whole monitor dedicated to just your pair's face is especially effective.

**Concerned Pair** commented: I'm new to my team and I'm always afraid I will just slow down my pair. Should I just take some time alone to ramp up before trying to pair?

> **Avery & Bella** replied: We find pairing is effective when both people are experienced pair programmers, but also equally effective at quickly turning an inexperienced teammate into an experienced one. When paired with a more experienced teammate, you'll be effective at delivering software on day one, and even *more* effective on day 100!
